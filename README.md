## Setup

Use a solution stack of your choice (like [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)), then clone this repo into the document root of your local server. On the sample page, there is an embedded HTML file hosted on jsDeliver. This is the file you can use to edit the React App.

## Using React

React is set up in an HTML file, loading scripts locally. In production, we'll only ever load scripts from jsDelivr's CDN.
